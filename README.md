A work in progress external written in purely assembly using the intel syntax and x86_64 architecture. 

As my compiler I choose nasm and I have linked a build script in scripts/build.sh.

To build this project you will ned `MSYS2 MINGW64` and the gcc and nasm compiler. 


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/penguin-cmyk/external.asm.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd external.asm
```

3. Navigate into the scripts folder:
```bash
cd scripts
```

4. Run the build script:
```nginx
sh build.sh
```
